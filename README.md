# Standard Agent üõ†Ô∏è ‚Äî Composable Agents

A **modular framework** for building AI agents that can plan, act, and **autonomously recover from failures**.
It ships with a ready-to-use *ReWOO* reasoning stack and the Jentic tool platform out of the box, but every layer is swappable.

### Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone and set up the project
git clone <repository-url>
cd standard_agent

# Install dependencies
make install

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the agent
python main.py
```

### Configuration

Before running the agent, you need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store your API keys and other secrets. The application will automatically load these variables.

Create a file named `.env` and add the following content, replacing the placeholder values with your actual keys:

```dotenv
# Jentic Platform API Key
JENTIC_API_KEY="your-jentic-api-key-here"

# LLM Provider API Keys (use the one for your chosen model)
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-api-key-here"
GEMINI_API_KEY="your-google-gemini-api-key-here"

# Tool-Specific Secrets (add as needed)
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-discord-bot-token-here"
```

**Note:** The `JENTIC_API_KEY` and at least one LLM provider key are essential for the agent to function.

You can obtain a jentic key by running the following line from your project directory with the virtual enviroment active:
``` bash
jentic register --email '<your_email>'
```

### Usage Examples

We provide two ways to use the agent framework: a quick-start method using a pre-built agent, and a more advanced method that shows how to build an agent from scratch.

#### 1. Quick Start: Running a Pre-built Agent

This is the fastest way to get started. The `ReWOOAgent` class provides a `StandardAgent` instance that is already configured with a powerful reasoner, LLM, tools, and memory.

```python
# main.py
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from agents.prebuilt import ReWOOAgent
from utils.cli import read_user_goal, print_result

# Load API keys from .env file
load_dotenv()

# 1. Get the pre-built agent.
agent = ReWOOAgent(model=os.getenv("LLM_MODEL", "claude-sonnet-4"))

# 2. Run the agent's main loop.
print("ü§ñ Agent is ready. Press Ctrl+C to exit.")
while True:
    goal_text = None
    try:
        goal = read_user_goal()
        if not goal:
            continue
        
        result = agent.solve(goal)
        print_result(result)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\nü§ñ Bye!")
        break
```

## ‚ú®  Key Principles
| Principle | What it means in Standard Agent                                                                     |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Composition** | Small, focused components are wired together at runtime.                                            |
| **Explicit DI** | LLM, Memory and Tools are injected once by the `StandardAgent` and broadcast to all sub-components. |
| **Swappable everything** | Swap reasoning strategies, memory back-ends or tool providers without touching agent logic.         |
| **Zero-boilerplate CLI** | A fully working CLI agent is  ~40 lines of glue code.                                               |
| **Self-healing** | Reflector components analyse errors, edit the plan and retry automatically.                         |

### Core Runtime Objects

| Layer            | Class / Protocol                                                | Notes                                                                    |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent**        | `StandardAgent`                                                 | Owns LLM, Memory, and Tools; injects them into a Reasoner.               |
| **Reasoners**    | `SequentialReasoner`, `TreeSearchReasoner`, etc.                | Each orchestrates a different reasoning algorithm.                       |
| **Memory**       | `BaseMemory`                               | A key-value store accessible to all components.                          |
| **Tools**        | `JustInTimeToolingBase`                  | Abstracts external actions (APIs, shell commands, etc.).                 |
| **Inbox / Outbox** | `BaseInbox` / `BaseOutbox`                                      | Decouples I/O, allowing the agent to run in any environment.             |
| **LLM Wrapper**  | `BaseLLM`                                     | Provides a uniform interface for interacting with different LLMs.        |

### The Sequential Reasoner

The `SequentialReasoner` is the default reasoning engine. It follows a classic **Plan -> Execute -> Reflect** loop, and its logic is broken down into four distinct, swappable components:

- **Plan**: Takes the user's goal and generates a step-by-step plan.
  - *Example*: `BulletListPlan`
- **Step Executor**: Executes a single step from the plan, often by calling a tool.
  - *Example*: `ReWOOExecuteStep`
- **Reflector**: If a step fails, this component analyzes the error and decides how to recover (e.g., retry, change the plan).
  - *Example*: `ReWOOReflector`
- **Summarizer**: Once the plan is complete, this component synthesizes the final answer for the user.
  - *Example*: `DefaultSummarizeResult`

This design allows you to customize the reasoning process by mixing and matching different implementations for each stage.

### Extending the Framework

The framework is designed to be modular. Here are some common extension points:

| Need                               | How to Implement                                                                                             |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Different reasoning strategy**   | Create a new `BaseReasoner` implementation (e.g., `TreeSearchReasoner`) and inject it into `StandardAgent`.      |
| **Custom planner**                 | Sub-class `Plan`, place it in `reasoner/sequential/planners/`, and wire it into your `SequentialReasoner`. |
| **Slack / Discord integration**    | Implement a `SlackOutbox` by sub-classing `BaseOutbox` and pass it to the `agent.tick()` method.             |
| **Redis / VectorDB memory**        | Implement a `RedisMemory` by sub-classing `BaseMemory` and inject it into the `StandardAgent`.                 |
| **Local shell tools**              | Create a `ShellToolInterface` that implements the `JustInTimeToolingBase` contract and inject it into the `StandardAgent`. |

## üîÆ Roadmap

- Async agent loop & concurrency-safe inboxes
- Additional pre-built reasoner implementations (ReAct, ToT, Graph-of-Thought)
- More out of the box composable parts to enable custom agents or reasoner implementations
- Web dashboard (live agent state + logs)
- Vector-store memory with RAG planning
- Slack / Discord integration
- Redis / VectorDB memory
- Ideas are welcome! [Open an issue](https://github.com/jentic/standard-agent/issues) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/jentic/standard-agent/pulls).
